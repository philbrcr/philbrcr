<h1>👋 Hello! Welcome to my little corner of GitHub</h1>

Like many others, I am actively looking for my next gig 🧑‍💻, so I built my GitHub profile to showcase some of my skills and abilities. Here is a little bit about me:

- 🤘 Hi, I’m Ryan, aka @philbrcr
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, monitoring & evaluating all kinds of programs/projects, and operations.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my data analytics skills 
- 📫 How to reach me: https://bit.ly/m/Ryan-Philbrick
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've met every US President who has held office since 1977, except one.

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
I am seeking senior leadership roles in program management, communications, operations, or public relations within the technology or cybersecurity industries. 
</p>

<h2>Why Should You Hire Me Though?</h2>
<p>That's the main question really, isn't it? Why should you hire me? </p>

- One key thing that I think companies would value is my unique ability to bridge technical, operational, legal, and marketing teams across the public and private sectors.

I’ve dedicated my career to leading with empathy while driving transformational outcomes. Whether I’m creating operational frameworks that increase coordination by 200%, designing strategic messaging for international public awareness campaigns, or overseeing international operations, my approach combines measurable impact with an unwavering focus on team culture.

> Ryan's enthusiasm is contagious! He has worked for me for over 4 years and has grown significantly as a manager and communications specialist. He has mastered multiple areas of the organization, built trust with clients, and leads his communications team from the front while having everyone's back. I'm a proud member of Ryan's circle and hope to stay there throughout his career.

Kaitlin Jewell, Associate Director, CISA International Affairs
> “Ryan, or as we call him “Philbrick,” has been instrumental in turning around CISA International Affairs’ operations. From the start, he has jumped into the work, identifying efficiencies, solutions, and connections across all of CISA’s missions and programs. He is a wealth of knowledge and innovation - anyone would be lucky to have him on their team.”

Ryan Garnowski, Communications Program Manager, PCI Federal
> Ryan is an incredible leader with a passion for innovation. While leading various awareness campaigns for CISA’s Stakeholder Engagement Division, he advised senior leaders, federal staff, and teammates on key messages, target audiences, and strategic themes. Without his support, the division’s myriad of outreach and education initiatives would not have been possible.
